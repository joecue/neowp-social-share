# NEO WP Social Sharing - WordPress Plugin

WordPress Plugin developed to show how to create Plugins.  Demoed during the [NEO West WP Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NEOWordPress/events/239510791/).

## Features

- Custom Fields on the General Settings tab of the WordPress Admin to capture the user's Facebook and Twitter Profiles.
- Creates metabox custom fields on pages and posts to provide open graph data for Facebook shares.
- Creates function to add social sharing icons to bottom of post and page content for site vistitors to share the content.

### How this repo is organized

Since this plugin repo was used for a demo at a meetup, I wanted something that the attendees could follow along with if they chose to.  After seeing one of [Roy Sivan's](https://github.com/royboy789) talks at [WPCampus](https://www.wpcampus.org) I decided to try and use his approach.  Thus the repo is organized in the following way.

- Master Branch
  - Contains the completed project (if you don't want to see the step-by-step progression of the project).
- Base Branch
  - Contains the intial commit (during the demo this is where I started from)
- 1-admin
  - Contains the code to create the two settings field on the general settings page of the WordPress Admin to capture the Facebook and Twitter profile names.
